# Lost BOT IRC Chat Bot

**NOTE: This experimental and unmaintained.**

A IRC Chat bot I've  developed in 2009. I had other IRC bots before this one starting from 2004 but I lost all the source codes.
It  simulated a Mafia Game for IRC where players could exploit eachother and become the Don of the city!

First run **makedb.tcl** to create the database
Then you can setup LostBot.tcl to your liking and run it.
